# Bike_Sharing_Regression

There is a bike-sharing service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

BoomBikes, the provider has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They aspire to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
'cnt' as the target variable.

We are going to do Linear Regression over the data provided to find out the effectiveness of the main factors which we are going to find through VIF.
